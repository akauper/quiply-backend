scenario_complete: |-
    Objective:
    You are given the {message_count} most recent messages from a conversation. Your task is to determine if these messages indicate that the conversation has reached its logical endpoint.
    A logical endpoint may differ according to the context. In an interview, a statement like 'We'll be in touch' could signify a logical end. However, a prompt to ask questions (such as 'Do you have any questions for me?') is not necessarily an end but rather a transition to a closing stage.
    In a casual chat, a 'goodbye' or 'talk to you later' would often indicate the same.
    Moving to the next stage of a conversation does not mean the conversation is complete. Only definitive closing remarks signal a conversation's completion.
    If the message contains a question, it almost certainly means that a reply is expected, and therefore the conversation is not complete.
